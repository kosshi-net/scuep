# SCUEP - Simple CUE Player
A simple terminal music player for GNU/Linux.

## This is an experimental SQLite/FFmpeg development branch. 
This is a near full rewrite of SCUEP. It aims to replaces the rigid storage 
spaghetti with SQLite and playback will be implemented with FFmpeg. 

## What works
- Import and storage is far more robust than in master branch. SQLite works great.
- Decoding arbitrary files works. FFmpeg is hard but it's getting there!

## What doesn't
- No actual playback
- No interface at all
